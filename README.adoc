== What you'll learn

You will learn how to expose and filter APIs of RESTful web services from annotations, static OpenAPI files,
and/or OpenAPI trees using MicroProfile OpenAPI.

=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root directory of this guide contains two services that have been configured
to use MicroProfile OpenTracing. Feel free to give them a try before you proceed.

To try out the services, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then execute the following
Maven goals to build the services and run them in two instances of Open Liberty:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

Point your browser to

Once you are done checking out the services, stop both Open Liberty servers:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.

Annotations:
1. Enable the feature to see the skeleton document generated
2. Demonstrate annotating simple methods (list method)
3. Demonstrate annotating slightly more complex methods, with multiple responses (system/<hostname>)
4. Demonstrate annotating a POJO (InvList?)

Static OpenAPI files:
- show how this can be done for the system service

Programming model:

Filter:
- filter description for APIResponse and change it
- mention that in order to get rid of an element, then null can be returned.


Processing rules:
- dont need to talk about these?

other:
- talk about limitations (restriction to one app) + everything else in section 5
- link to existing demo apps
- cannot have more than one jax-rs application
