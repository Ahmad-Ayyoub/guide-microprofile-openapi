=== Try what you'll build

The `finish` directory in the root directory of this guide contains two services that have been configured
to use MicroProfile OpenTracing. Feel free to give them a try before you proceed.

To try out the services, first navigate to the `finish` directory and then execute the following
Maven goals to build the services and run them in two instances of Open Liberty:

```
mvn install liberty:start-server
```

Point your browser to

Once you are done checking out the services, stop both Open Liberty servers:

```
mvn liberty:stop-server
```

Now, navigate back to the `start` directory to begin.
